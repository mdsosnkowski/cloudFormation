Project Title: Simple To-Do List API

Date: May 12 ‚Äì May 16, 2025
Purpose: AI-generated lab to gain hands-on experience with AWS Lambda and API Gateway integration.

Overview:
This project demonstrates a basic setup of a serverless API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. The Lambda function serves as the backend logic, while API Gateway exposes HTTP endpoints to interact with the Lambda service.

AI Chat Link: (Insert link here if applicable)
Architecture Components

AWS Lambda

    Purpose: Handles backend logic for the API.

    Current Implementation: Returns a default "Hello, World" response.

Amazon API Gateway

    Purpose: Provides HTTP endpoints to access Lambda functions.

    Role: Acts as the public-facing interface for client requests.

Work Log
May 12

    Tasks Completed:

        Created a basic AWS Lambda function using the default "Hello, World" template.

        Connected the Lambda function to API Gateway.

    Focus:

        Understand how API Gateway receives and forwards Lambda function responses.

    Outstanding Question:

        How do users submit requests to the endpoint (e.g., through curl, Postman, or a frontend app)?

# Simple To-Do List API

**Date:** May 12 ‚Äì May 16, 2025  
**Purpose:** AI-generated lab to learn and apply AWS Lambda and API Gateway integration.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. The Lambda function serves as the backend processor, while API Gateway exposes HTTP endpoints to handle client requests. This foundational setup provides the groundwork for building a full-featured To-Do list API.

## Architecture Components

### AWS Lambda
- **Role:** Backend logic processor
- **Status:** Returns a default "Hello, World" message
- **Next Steps:** Replace placeholder logic with actual To-Do list operations (e.g., add, delete, list items)

### Amazon API Gateway
- **Role:** Public-facing HTTP endpoint provider
- **Status:** Successfully integrated with the Lambda function
- **Next Steps:** Define additional routes for full CRUD functionality

---

## Work Log

### May 12, 2025
- **Tasks Completed:**
  - Created Lambda function using default "Hello, World" template
  - Integrated Lambda with API Gateway

- **Focus:**  
  - Understand how API Gateway receives and routes responses from Lambda

- **Open Question:**  
  - How do users submit requests to the endpoint? (e.g., via Postman, curl, or frontend app)

---

## Future Improvements
- Implement CRUD functionality for To-Do items
- Add request validation via API Gateway models or Lambda logic
- Enable CORS for frontend integration
- Deploy using AWS CloudFormation or SAM

## Inverted logic used in the project
# Learning CloudFormation Faster with Inverse Logic

Use inverse logic to uncover learning pitfalls and reinforce strong habits. Here are three mindset traps‚Äîand the truths that will help you learn AWS CloudFormation more effectively:

---

### 1. ‚ùå ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to understand the resources I‚Äôm declaring.‚Äù

- ‚úÖ **Inverse Truth:** You must understand each AWS resource (like `AWS::EC2::Instance`, `AWS::IAM::Role`, etc.) to write effective CloudFormation templates.
- üß† **Why it helps:** Treating CloudFormation as just YAML/JSON will limit you‚Äîunderstanding how the actual AWS services behave is critical.

---

### 2. ‚ùå ‚ÄúDebugging CloudFormation errors isn‚Äôt worth my time‚ÄîI‚Äôll just try random fixes.‚Äù

- ‚úÖ **Inverse Truth:** You should treat every CloudFormation error as an opportunity to deeply understand the template and service behavior.
- üß† **Why it helps:** CloudFormation errors are painful but precise‚Äîthey often point to misunderstandings in IAM, dependencies, or resource properties.

---

### 3. ‚ùå ‚ÄúI‚Äôll learn CloudFormation by reading templates without building anything myself.‚Äù

- ‚úÖ **Inverse Truth:** Actively building, deploying, and modifying real CloudFormation stacks teaches far more than passive reading.
- üß† **Why it helps:** Real feedback from the AWS environment (success, failure, drift, rollback) reinforces concepts faster than theory alone.

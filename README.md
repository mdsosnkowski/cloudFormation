# METHOD: Question Design Development

### Use the format below to learn code and for long term memory.
### ASK-DOCS-TRY-FAIL / AI HINT/ TEACH

| Principle                 | Alignment with Method                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active Recall**         | “TRY” and “TEACH” phases demand memory retrieval.   |
| **Spaced Repetition**     | “REPEAT” encourages spaced and varied practice.     |
| **Desirable Difficulty**  | “FAIL” creates productive struggle.                 |
| **Interleaving**          | Each loop can target a new concept or variation.    |
| **Generation Effect**     | “TRY” forces code creation from memory.             |
| **Feedback & Correction** | “FAIL” + “AI HINT” give real-time corrective input. |
| **Self-Explanation**      | “TEACH” phase activates deep processing.            |


### Phases: ASK → DOCS → TRY → FAIL → AI HINT/TEACH → REPEAT
1. ASK (Formulate a Question)

    What to do: Write a question or problem statement before reading any documentation.

    Example: "How can I make an AWS Lambda function send an email using SES?"

2. DOCS (Self-Guided Research)

    What to do: Search the official documentation or trusted technical blogs for answers.

    Goal: Find a concept, code snippet, or explanation that helps answer your question.

3. TRY (Hands-On Practice)

    What to do: Write code based on what you’ve read.

    Principle: Active recall + generation effect — you remember better by producing, not just reviewing.

4. FAIL (Intentional Testing to Break It)

    What to do: Run your code. Expect failure. Look at the output. Debug.

    Why: Desirable difficulties and immediate feedback help form stronger memory pathways.

5. AI HINT / TEACH (Get Unstuck or Explain)

    If stuck: Ask AI (like me) for a hint, not the full solution.

    If not stuck: Try to teach what you just learned, in plain English, to the AI.

    Why: Teaching strengthens understanding (Feynman technique); small hints prevent frustration while keeping the learning effortful.

6. REPEAT (Refine & Expand)

    What to do: Refactor your code, add comments, or expand the use case slightly.

    Example: After email works, add an attachment or error handling.

    Why: Spaced repetition and incremental learning deepen long-term retention.
